# Old_Car_Price-Prediction-Model
This project aims to predict the price of used cars by applying machine learning regression techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of used car listings and can estimate a car's value based on its features, such as age, mileage, and brand. This can help sellers price their vehicles competitively and buyers make informed decisions.
